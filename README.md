# Efficient-Storage-of-Vehicle-Locations-for-Vehicle-Hiring-Applications
This system was a programming assignments required for data structures course in King Saud University : 
Introduction to the system : 
Vehicle hiring companies such as Uber rely on fast localization of available vehicles near potential customers. Such efficient localization requires specialized data structures, and the goal of this project is to implement and use one such data structure. 
vehicles and customers are localized using GPS devices available in mobile phones, and these devices determine the longitude and latitude coordinates as floating-point numbers. 
For simplicity the map was decided into small cells so we used integers to identify each location on the map When a customer request a ride, only vehicles within a certain range of this customer will be contacted
